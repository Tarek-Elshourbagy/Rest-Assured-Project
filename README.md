### Overview
This project includes test cases for performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on user data via a REST API. The tests are built using the TestNG framework, and RestAssured is used to interact with the API.

### Technologies Used
 - Java: Programming language used for writing test scripts.
 - RestAssured: A Java-based library for testing RESTful APIs.
 - TestNG: A testing framework used for running and organizing tests.
 - Maven: Dependency management tool to manage libraries and dependencies.
### Setup Instructions
#### Prerequisites:
 - Java 8 or above installed.
 - Maven installed for dependency management.
 - An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code to run the project.
### Test Case Descriptions
This project includes five test cases that interact with the API as follows:

#### TC_01_Create_User:
